Instead of creating every individual enemy in a level, an array can create an entire set at once.
In my knowledge, arrays are a container of several objects of the same type where the individual
objects can be accessed easily and all of the objects can be altered using less code.

Examples: 
1. An egg box containing egg objects.
2. a box with a deck of cards objects inside.
3. an envelope containing several papers
4. a folder containing papers as well
5. cookie jar full of cookie objects.
6. pictures in a collage or slide show.
7. powerpoint slides in another slide show.
8. bullets in a gun cartridge.
9. pages in a book
10. apples on a tree.
